## Hacktoberfest 2018 Report

This Hacktoberfest was my first one, and it was exciting. I had some minor edits for a couple of the repositories I contributed to, but they were always quite willing to accept. I submitted the following:

* a program I had written at school for basic OpenCV operation in C++
* various edits in content, security hardening, and typos (including one major blocker that affected backend-frontend CMS post publishing) for a PEAK Student Council website
* various edits that began this site; including adjustments to weight, extra button settings, and the beginning of an experimental process to host files directly on this website

As a bonus, later on (after November 1st) when I was working on my coursework in _Deep Learning with Python_ (a Manning Publishing book by Mr. Francois Chollet that I highly recommend for a read) - I noted a somewhat confusing typo that was both in the paper text and the iPy-notebook, and as previous bug fixes of the iPynb had not corrected this error - I made a pull request for it.

### Background

I've only been in one other Hackathon ([Junction Asia](https://junctionasia.github.io/index.html); now [Junction Tokyo](https://tokyo.hackjunction.com/)) and at the time I was [not very sure what I was doing](https://devpost.com/software/tentatively-club-home "DJing, probably") in the field yet, as I had not much experience coding anything. It was in my first year of University, and it would be another semester before I even took my first course involving any level of real programming - the Android programming course where I first made the framework of the PASMO/SUICA application ([test the alpha](http://smarturl.it/GET-SICCR)).

One thing I had not done yet, though, was make my own portfolio website, let alone any website at all. And just in time for the Hacktoberfest (\~late September), the [PEAK Student Council](https://peakstudentcouncil.org) (one of my clubs at school) had asked me as chair of IT to start work on a new website to showcase our activities. This was a good opportunity for stickers and a T-shirt, courtesy some very kind companies who sponsor the event -- so I decided it was worth an attempt and gave it my best shot.

As a side note, the main sponsor of the event, DigitalOcean, makes some cool Virtual Private Servers (VPS) instances available. These can be used with the [_Github Education Pack_](https://education.github.com) to obtain a usage credit (50usd worth) and the [NameCheap for Education '.me'](https://nc.me/) domain agent to host your own WordPress site - which I almost did, but eventually decided against.
