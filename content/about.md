## Setup

This site was made with the static-website generator [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/), which is built in [Go](http://golang.org/).

The ['coder' theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-coder/) was used to make this website, and various members of the ['Engineering Students' Discord server](https://discord.gg/EngineeringStudents) helped debug some early issues. They have since contributed to some of the site design, header debugging, and resume reviews. Many thanks to them all.

Currently, [Forestry CMS](https://app.forestry.io) is powering this website's page and post creation.
