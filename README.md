Greetings! Welcome to the source code repositiory for the deveopment branch of my website.
(That means that this README will be slightly longer and more rambling than the one in my master branch.)

The develpoment site is found at https://alexpersonal-dev.netlify.com/ and is separate (if often equal or ahead) of my primary website.

As the development site indicates:
(a) This repo was made for live-site building via netlify. I decided I would not bother trying to host my own server and run HUGO on it, while maitaining a constant uptime (not to mention how expensive that would be).
(b) I did not take out a custom-domain for my development site. If this makes a difference to anyone, please contact me and I would be happy to receive your donation of a domain.
(b1) Domain renewals were not cheap this year. Your donation would certainly be appreciated.

The site was originally built from my University campus in Tokyo as a part of a self-driven project.

As with most of my hack projects, I  choose something that would be of use to my near-future - as I was starting the process of job-searching, I decided to make a website to introduce myself.

As of the first writing of this file, I have finished setting my DNS for both www and non-www, and for the ME and COM TLDs. Future work will involve 'un-templating' the about page, and setting up more robust sub-pages, (including some debugging to find why a couple of the Japanese pages fail to stay in Japanese).

The above debugging was done and future edits of this site will clean up the forestry integration for easy CMS blog writing. Of course, this means that more time will soon be devoted to a variety of different sort of blog content.

I also added some of my own ideas to the site template.
(For example, I think the PDF resume folder is actually quite a good idea, as it help organise and host files directly onto the website.)

Open-source contributions, as with most things, are welcomed! Please make your own branch and submit requests when you have finished work to add to the site. If the demand arises (or more translations that are non-Japanese are added to the original HUGO 'coder' template repo then I will contribute a barebones template site version of this site as well. Feel free to reach out to me to ask for this.

As the Hugo site builder and the 'coder' theme used are also public-source, please feel free to clone this git repository for your own use as well!

Thanks and happy coding!
